# Ecommerce Back End 
This is back end application build for ecommerce site. It is working with Express.js API and configure it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

# Working
So in terminal in VS code when user enter database name, MySQL password and username then user will be connected to database using Sequelize. When user enter schema and seed commands then database will be created and seeded with test data.With this  server will be started and sequelize models are synced into MySQL.
